You may also want to explore my [How to Become a Coder](https://github.com/AlexMercedCoder/GuideToBecomingACoder) repo to see if being self-taught is the best option or whether other options like a bootcamp may be the right path. If you've just graduated from a bootcamp these pages will provide great guides to continue expanding your skills.
