# Python Self-Learn Rubric

## Step 1 - Learn the Language

Before creating a local setup let's get you acquainted with the basic syntax. Using http://www.Repl.it watch the following video series. (don't worry if they use something else to run the code, Repl should work fine.)

## Step 2 - Setup your local python environment

- Install Pycharm IDE - [Pycharm Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQ176FUIyIUZ1mwB-uImQE-gmkwzjNLjP)

- Learn about Virtual Environments - [Virtual Environments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWcrseHrh2w)

- Learn about PIP - [About PIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2ZN104hIcc)

## Step 3 - Learning Flask (Express for Python)

Minimalist web frameworks are a great way to get more comfortable with a language cause it provides you with less abstractions and relies more heavily on your raw lanaguage skills. Learn and developing with Flask will really help you grow with Python but also in building web servers.

**PROJECT** Build a web application that connects to a postgres database and delivers a full CRUD api.

## Step 4 - Building a game with Python

Games are another type of application that forces you to really use all aspects of a language, learn pygame!

**Project** Build a simple platformer game, doesn't have to be long or complex

## Step 5 - Learning Django

Django is a much more larger system for building web applications. At this point your python foundations should be much stronger making the abstractions Django provides much more powerful and less confusing. Django and Flask make up most of the demand for python developers in the web space.

**Build** Build a full stack application using Jinja templates

## Step 7 - Learn TensorFlow

TensorFlow is one of the largest frameworks for machine learning which is a hot job market right now. TensorFlow now only requires strong python skills but also the understanding of several mathmatical concepts, these tutorial should help you understand all of of this better.

## Step 8 - Learn Masonite

Not as popular as Flask or Django, but Masonite is a very robust web framework that brings a more Ruby on Rails type experience to Python.
