## Step 2 - Setup your local environment

Google how to install the latest PHP on your operating system (PHP 8 as of me writing this). Once that is installed you'll have access to the PHP CLI so let's spend sometime learning how to use the CLI.

On top of familiarity with the CLI you'll need an IDE to work with, I recommend using visual studio code. Watch this video on useful VSCode extensions for PHP.
